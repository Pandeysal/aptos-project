# ContentPaywall Smart Contract

## Vision

The **ContentPaywall** smart contract enables content creators and publishers to monetize their work by setting up a paywall for access. Users can access content by paying a fee, creating a decentralized and transparent payment system for digital content.

## Features

- **Setup Paywall**:
  - Publishers can create a paywall for specific content by setting a fee that users must pay to access the content.
- **Access Content**:
  - Users can pay the required fee to access the content, with the transaction recorded on-chain and funds transferred to the publisher.

## Future Scope

1. **Subscription-Based Access**:

   - Implement a subscription model for continuous access to multiple content pieces rather than one-time payments.

2. **Tiered Pricing**:

   - Add support for tiered pricing, where users can pay different amounts for varying levels of content access.

3. **Content Access History**:
   - Introduce tracking for users to see which content they have accessed and for publishers to view access history.

The **ContentPaywall** contract offers a secure and efficient way to monetize digital content, providing both publishers and users with transparency and flexibility in a decentralized ecosystem.
